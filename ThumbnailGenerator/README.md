agg-sharp
=========

 Agg-Sharp is the C# port of Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG), a GUI abstraction layer and various c# bits and pieces for developing apps and games. They are all in separate .dll's and easy to use incrementally. Agg-Sharp is an Open Source, free of charge graphic library. Agg-Sharp doesn't depend on any graphic API or technology. Basically, you can think of Agg-Sharp as of a rendering engine that produces pixel images in memory from vectorial data. The ideas and the philosophy of Agg-Sharp are: Anti-Aliasing. Subpixel Accuracy. The highest possible quality. High performance. Platform independence and compatibility. Flexibility and extensibility. Lightweight design. Reliability and stability (including numerical stability).
