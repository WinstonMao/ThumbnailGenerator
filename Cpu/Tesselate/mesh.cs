/* The mesh structure is similar in spirit, notation, and operations
 * to the "quad-edge" structure (see L. Guibas and J. Stolfi, Primitives
 * for the manipulation of general subdivisions and the computation of
 * Voronoi diagrams, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 4(2):74-123, April 1985).
 * For a simplified description, see the course notes for CS348a,
 * "Mathematical Foundations of Computer Graphics", available at the
 * Stanford bookstore (and taught during the fall quarter).
 * The implementation also borrows a tiny subset of the graph-based approach
 * use in Mantyla's Geometric Work Bench (see M. Mantyla, An Introduction
 * to Sold Modeling, Computer Science Press, Rockville, Maryland, 1988).
 *
 * The fundamental data structure is the "half-edge".  Two half-edges
 * go together to make an edge, but they point in opposite directions.
 * Each half-edge has a pointer to its mate (the "symmetric" half-edge Sym),
 * its origin vertex (Org), the face on its left side (Lface), and the
 * adjacent half-edges in the CCW direction around the origin vertex
 * (Onext) and around the left face (Lnext).  There is also a "next"
 * pointer for the global edge list (see below).
 *
 * The notation used for mesh navigation:
 *	Sym   = the mate of a half-edge (same edge, but opposite direction)
 *	Onext = edge CCW around origin vertex (keep same origin)
 *	Dnext = edge CCW around destination vertex (keep same dest)
 *	Lnext = edge CCW around left face (dest becomes new origin)
 *	Rnext = edge CCW around right face (origin becomes new dest)
 *
 * "prev" means to substitute CW for CCW in the definitions above.
 *
 * The mesh keeps global lists of all vertices, faces, and edges,
 * stored as doubly-linked circular lists with a dummy header node.
 * The mesh stores pointers to these dummy headers (vHead, fHead, eHead).
 *
 * The circular edge list is special; since half-edges always occur
 * in pairs (e and e.Sym), each half-edge stores a pointer in only
 * one direction.  Starting at eHead and following the e.next pointers
 * will visit each *edge* once (ie. e or e.Sym, but not both).
 * e.Sym stores a pointer in the opposite direction, thus it is
 * always true that e.Sym.next.Sym.next == e.
 *
 * Each vertex has a pointer to next and previous vertices in the
 * circular list, and a pointer to a half-edge with this vertex as
 * the origin (null if this is the dummy header).  There is also a
 * field "data" for client data.
 *
 * Each face has a pointer to the next and previous faces in the
 * circular list, and a pointer to a half-edge with this face as
 * the left face (null if this is the dummy header).  There is also
 * a field "data" for client data.
 *
 * Note that what we call a "face" is really a loop; faces may consist
 * of more than one loop (ie. not simply connected), but there is no
 * record of this in the data structure.  The mesh may consist of
 * several disconnected regions, so it may not be possible to visit
 * the entire mesh by starting at a half-edge and traversing the edge
 * structure.
 *
 * The mesh does NOT support isolated vertices; a vertex is deleted along
 * with its last edge.  Similarly when two faces are merged, one of the
 * faces is deleted.  For mesh operations,
 * all face (loop) and vertex pointers must not be null.  However, once
 * mesh manipulation is finished, ZapFace can be used to delete
 * faces of the mesh, one at a time.  All external faces can be "zapped"
 * before the mesh is returned to the client; then a null face indicates
 * a region which is not part of the output polygon.

	// the mesh class
	/* The mesh operations below have three motivations: completeness,
	 * convenience, and efficiency.  The basic mesh operations are MakeEdge,
	 * Splice, and Delete.  All the other edge operations can be implemented
	 * in terms of these.  The other operations are provided for convenience
	 * and/or efficiency.
	 *
	 * When a face is split or a vertex is added, they are inserted into the
	 * global list *before* the existing vertex or face (ie. e.Org or e.Lface).
	 * This makes it easier to process all vertices or faces in the global lists
	 * without worrying about processing the same data twice.  As a convenience,
	 * when a face is split, the "inside" flag is copied from the old face.
	 * Other internal data (v.data, v.activeRegion, f.data, f.marked,
	 * f.trail, e.winding) is set to zero.
	 *
	 * ********************** Basic Edge Operations **************************
	 *
	 * MakeEdge() creates one edge, two vertices, and a loop.
	 * The loop (face) consists of the two new half-edges.
	 *
	 * Splice( eOrg, eDst ) is the basic operation for changing the
	 * mesh connectivity and topology.  It changes the mesh so that
	 *	eOrg.Onext <- OLD( eDst.Onext )
	 *	eDst.Onext <- OLD( eOrg.Onext )
	 * where OLD(...) means the value before the meshSplice operation.
	 *
	 * This can have two effects on the vertex structure:
	 *  - if eOrg.Org != eDst.Org, the two vertices are merged together
	 *  - if eOrg.Org == eDst.Org, the origin is split into two vertices
	 * In both cases, eDst.Org is changed and eOrg.Org is untouched.
	 *
	 * Similarly (and independently) for the face structure,
	 *  - if eOrg.Lface == eDst.Lface, one loop is split into two
	 *  - if eOrg.Lface != eDst.Lface, two distinct loops are joined into one
	 * In both cases, eDst.Lface is changed and eOrg.Lface is unaffected.
	 *
	 * __gl_meshDelete( eDel ) removes the edge eDel.  There are several cases:
	 * if (eDel.Lface != eDel.Rface), we join two loops into one; the loop
	 * eDel.Lface is deleted.  Otherwise, we are splitting one loop into two;
	 * the newly created loop will contain eDel.Dst.  If the deletion of eDel
	 * would create isolated vertices, those are deleted as well.
	 *
	 * ********************** Other Edge Operations **************************
	 *
	 * __gl_meshAddEdgeVertex( eOrg ) creates a new edge eNew such that
	 * eNew == eOrg.Lnext, and eNew.Dst is a newly created vertex.
	 * eOrg and eNew will have the same left face.
	 *
	 * __gl_meshSplitEdge( eOrg ) splits eOrg into two edges eOrg and eNew,
	 * such that eNew == eOrg.Lnext.  The new vertex is eOrg.Dst == eNew.Org.
	 * eOrg and eNew will have the same left face.
	 *
	 * __gl_meshConnect( eOrg, eDst ) creates a new edge from eOrg.Dst
	 * to eDst.Org, and returns the corresponding half-edge eNew.
	 * If eOrg.Lface == eDst.Lface, this splits one loop into two,
	 * and the newly created loop is eNew.Lface.  Otherwise, two disjoint
	 * loops are merged into one, and the loop eDst.Lface is destroyed.
	 *
	 * ************************ Other Operations *****************************
	 *
	 * __gl_meshNewMesh() creates a new mesh with no edges, no vertices,
	 * and no loops (what we usually call a "face").
	 *
	 * __gl_meshUnion( mesh1, mesh2 ) forms the union of all structures in
	 * both meshes, and returns the new mesh (the old meshes are destroyed).
	 *
	 * __gl_meshDeleteMesh( mesh ) will free all storage for any valid mesh.
	 *
	 * __gl_meshZapFace( fZap ) destroys a face and removes it from the
	 * global face list.  All edges of fZap will have a null pointer as their
	 * left face.  Any edges which also have a null pointer as their right face
	 * are deleted entirely (along with any isolated vertices this produces).
	 * An entire mesh can be deleted by zapping its faces, one at a time,
	 * in any order.  Zapped faces cannot be used in further mesh operations!
	 *
	 * __gl_meshCheckMesh( mesh ) checks a mesh for self-consistency.
